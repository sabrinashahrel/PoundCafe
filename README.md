Jan 2021 â€“ Feb 2021

Project description
For Web Secure Programming subject, my group consists of seven students required to develop web-based system. Therefore, we decided to develop a system for cafe named pound by using html, css, php and mysql.

There is two users which is customer and staff.

Customer can view all the information regarding the cafe such as location, menu and working time.
Staff can add, delete and edit the menu in this system.
